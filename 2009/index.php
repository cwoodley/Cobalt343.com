        <p>My name is Cale Woodley and I'm a huge dork who loves the internet.</p>
        <p>As a little kid my favorite toy was Lego. For hours I'd be making moon-bases, race tracks and helicopters with death rays on them. I just loved the way the parts fit together, the soft way a pair of bricks would click together is rather sublime and successfully completing a major project was possibly the best feeling in the world at the time (my previous best achievement was finding all 96 exits in Super Mario World).</p>
        <p>These days I love putting websites together, getting that perfect match of floats and clears to get that product shot to fit in just right on the grid. Or adjusting the opacity of that border to get a button's active state just so. Perhaps tuning some effect chaining in jQuery to make the UI just that little-bit-more responsive. </p>
        <p>I like to think of XHTML combined with CSS and Javascript as Lego for my grownup self. It's just as fun.</p>
